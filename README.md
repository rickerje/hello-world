About me:
I'm a writer and beginning programmer. I finished a B.S. in computer science back in 2001 but didn't do anything with it (thanks, dot-com bubble), and now I'm trying to shake the dust off those skills and hopefully improve them. I finished my degree studying C++ and some web scripting. Since then I've learned more HTML and CSS, as well as a smattering of PHP. I'm currently learning Python.
